# Hello, World! 🌍 I'm Nana 🐶

No, not the dog from Peter Pan, but just as loyal and adventurous! I'm a woman who loves to code, not a canine, but I promise I'm just as friendly!

## About Me 🙋‍♀️

- 🖥️ I'm currently working as a Senior Software Engineer, not a dog walker, but I can debug your code and fetch your slippers at the same time!
- ❤️ I'm interested in everything Artificial Intelligence and Full Stack Development. I can't fly like Peter Pan, but I can make your website fly with efficient code!
- ⏳ Currently exploring Google Cloud & Microsoft Azure. I'm not searching for Neverland, but I am on a quest for knowledge!
- 🎯 Life Hack: "Explore 🔥 and Explode 💣 with knowledge". Not with pixie dust, but with hard work and dedication!
- ✍️ I love sharing creative tech stack tools. Check out [tech-stack.tools](https://tech-stack.tools) for more details. I promise it's more fun than chasing your tail!

## Fun Fact 🎭

Did you know? My name is the same as the dog in Peter Pan, but unlike Nana the dog, I can code in multiple languages! 🐾
